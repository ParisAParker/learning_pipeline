## ðŸ§  Overview

The **Learning Pipeline** is an automated system that converts educational content (YouTube videos or raw text) into structured learning materials such as:

- ðŸ§© **Open-ended quizzes** with sample answers  
- ðŸ“˜ **PDF study sheets** (student + teacher versions)  
- ðŸ§  **Anki flashcards** for spaced-repetition learning  

Itâ€™s built around research from **Dr. Andrew Huberman** and cognitive science studies showing that **retrieval practice** â€” *testing yourself on information instead of re-reading it* â€” dramatically improves long-term retention.

> **Motivation:**  
> Most people learn passively by consuming videos or text. This pipeline helps you practice *active recall* automatically, turning everything you study into an interactive test.
