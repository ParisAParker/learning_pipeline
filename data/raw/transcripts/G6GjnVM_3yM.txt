The following is a call with a CS
graduate of a 4-year program who's
looking to get into data analytics and
claims to have worked extensively with
Python in the context of machine
learning.
I just graduated like two weeks ago.
So you use Python?
I have a lot of
uh Yeah, I use Python. I use like um for
like a IML I use Python.
What version of Python do you use?
Uh 3.11 on like my uh my laptop and then
on uh Google Collab. I don't know which
version it is
everything in how would you check if you
wanted to know
uh Python 3 uh dash dash version
okay how what what other way can you
check
um
I don't know that's like what's what I
use
uh have you do you know what the ripple
is
what
today's video sponsor answer is me. I
built this site called getcracked.io
because I noticed that there was a
massive skill gap between what
candidates know and what they should
know. This isn't only skill up and
interview prep content focused on
language knowledge. It also includes
things like operating systems,
concurrency, design patterns, computer
architecture with questions asked from
top firms around the world. I also have
a coding section here that teaches you
real world concepts. These aren't toy
puzzles. These aren't contrived problems
with principles like dynamic programming
which you will rarely use ever in your
career. These are real questions with
real implementations and real
explanations. Many of them having
appeared in interviews in the past. Make
sure to check it out. Do you know what
the ripple is?
Ripple. How do you uh spell it?
R pl.
No. No. I don't know. I don't know what
that is.
Oh, read evaluate print loop.
Uh,
you haven't heard about So,
wait, what?
You haven't heard about the Python
ripple?
No, no, no. I I think I skipped like all
the like fundamentals and just like go
straight up to ML cuz like when I
started to learn like programming like
uh I use like C and C++ but that was
like four years ago.
Uh, do you know what type hinting is in
Python?
Type what? Type hinting
type hinting I don't know that
so if I wanted to annotate a function
with the type of its inputs how would
you do that?
So if I was to write like add right and
I would do add and I would do pass in x
and y to the add method and it would
return a value right because I add two
things together.
How would I how would I hint to the user
that uses ad what the input parameters
types should be?
Uh
wait let me let me visualize it in my
mind.
Sure. So think of writing an ad method
and passing an x and y and then how do I
tell the consumer of that ad method what
the types of x and y should be?
Uh
you don't cuz like uh you don't have to
like specify the type.
You don't have to, but you can be
helpful and and specify to the client.
Uh
um
yeah, I don't think I I don't really
know.
Okay. Have you ever seen Python code
where it's like X colon int?
X colint.
Um,
have you seen like X colon int?
No.
Okay, that would be how type hinting
works. I'm curious. Um, do you know what
integer division is in Python?
So if I was to do like if I was to do
uh 3 / two in Python,
what would the result be?
Result would be 3 / 2. So that would be
uh 1.5,
right? And how would I write that in
Python?
Um,
so like you would uh assign a variable
for it. For example, uh,
no, don't don't worry about assigning
variables, just writing it out.
Oh, three slash two,
right? So, what what happens if I did
three slash slash two? So, two slashes.
That would be square root.
Are you sure?
Wait, no. No. slash slash.
Um,
yeah, I don't really know to be honest.
Okay, that would be integer division,
right? Right. Right.
So that would be 3 / two. That would
give you one cuz it would floor. It
would do 1.5 and it would floor.
It would floor like automatically.
Yeah.
All right, cool.
Yeah. And so we just brought up the
concept of pointers. And so my question
for you is if I have the statement x
equals 1.
Where is one stored? And where is let's
actually make it a little different.
Let's say I have a class called a. I
just a class called a um and it's empty.
Has no methods, no data members. And I
do x equals a. Right? So I create an
object a. Where is x stored? And where
is a stored?
Um, class A and it's empty. And then X
equals A.
Yeah.
Uh,
uh, I have no idea.
Have you heard of the concept of stack
and heap?
Oh, yeah. stack and heap.
Okay, so if you've heard of the concept
of stack and heap, do you know what they
are?
So stack is the data structure that the
uh
the method is uh a method of inserting
and uh
we were but we were just we were just
talking about uh storage not data
structures.
Oh
so I'm talking about stack and heap in
the context of operating systems.
uh stack and heaps. Uh stack is like the
process like for CNS out like it's used
in uh
we're not talking about data structures.
We're talking about operating systems.
If you haven't heard of stack and heap
in the context of operating systems,
that's fine. I just want to make sure
we're talking about the same thing. Have
you heard about it in the context of
operating systems or No,
I've heard about it.
Do you know? Okay. I actually don't like
the word I've heard cuz you can I've
heard about quantum mechanics. I don't
know [ __ ] about it. So what I'm guessing
is do do you know what it is?
Yeah, I don't know what it is.
Okay, then we'll we'll skip that for
now.
Um so we we mentioned that everything in
Python is an object. So if everything is
an object, everything is stored on the
heap, but the reference to that object
is stored on the stack. So X would be
stored on the stack, but you know class
A would be stored on the heap. We we
just talked about classes though, right?
I mentioned class A, right?
Right.
If I wanted to initial, if I wanted to
write class A in Python and have nothing
inside of it, just an empty class, how
would you do that?
What would that look like in code? You
can describe it to me.
Class A is empty. So,
class
A and then
class A and then um
I don't know what's the word.
Yeah, colon and then
space and then
uh
Wait, is class an object? So you would
use like self dot.
Well, we want it to be empty. So we
don't want any implementation.
So I'm going to give you I'm going to
give you a hint.
It starts with P
P S.
Yeah, I cannot I cannot recall.
Pass.
Pass. Oh, yeah. Pass.
Yeah. Um, how how does a list look like
in Python?
What's the syntax to write a list?
Um, curly bracket. No, no, no. Uh, it's
the it's the I don't know what it's
called. It's the uh square bracket,
right? Do you know what a tpple is?
Yeah, I know what a tpple is.
What's the difference between a tpple
and a list?
So topple is so you have for list you
have let's say uh an integers in a list.
So like 0 1 2 3 4 5. But when it comes
to tpple, you can uh you can al you can
mix strings and uh integers as well
inside that uh
I'm pretty sure you can do that with a
list too.
Um so topple maybe it's uh it's more uh
it's more
liberal than a list is. So you have you
can uh put
uh not just like list uh not just like
integers and strings together but you
can also
uh hold other objects. So
that's not the difference
they say like yeah
you don't know the difference.
Okay. Um, tpples are immutable, so they
can't be altered.
Right. Right. Right. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Right. Right. Right.
That's just one property of a tpple. How
would I How would I write a tpple in
Python?
I have no idea.
Okay. Well, then don't say I know what a
tpple is if you have no idea how to
write one.
Yeah. So, I was going to ask you, how do
you write a tpple of size one,
but you you aren't sure what a tpple is?
And that's okay, but um well, I guess
it's not okay that you don't know what a
tuple is, actually. And it's even more
not okay that you say you know what it
is and then you don't cuz that in an
interview will kill you,
right?
Like immediately.
Um Okay. Do you know if uh do you know
why, for example? So if do you know how
to open up a file in in in Python?
Yeah.
Okay. How do you do that?
Um like open to read or just like open
it.
Yeah. Let's say you want to open it to
to read it.
uh
like on terminal I just go like usually
I just uh if I want to read then the
contents I really just like use cat
in Python though.
Oh in Python
that's the that's the topic of the
discussion.
Yeah. I don't know.
Okay. And you you mentioned you're a
data analyst.
Um data science.
So what do you do at work?
I I don't have a job yet. Like I'm still
searching. Like I just got interviews
and interview. Uh
sorry I cut you off. Say that again.
So
I was applying for cuz like my projects
are mostly machine learning, deep
learning. So
I I don't understand how you're doing
machine learning and deep learning if
you don't know the difference between a
list and a tpple. That's such a big
mistake that I see people doing. Like,
what should I learn to be a machine
learning engineer? Dude, you're not, no
offense, but you don't even know what a
ripple is. What the ripple is?
That's like Python 101. You sit down in
the your first class with the professor.
What did you study in? Sorry. What did
you study in school again?
Um, computer science, but
and you don't know what the ripple is.
Okay. Yeah, cuz like like at the first
like the uh the the language that I use
for like all of that is like C and C++.
Oh, okay. So, you're familiar with C++?
I wouldn't say I'm familiar, but I use
it uh like 3 years ago.
Okay. I don't want to ask you anything
about three years ago.
Yeah.
But that's still not I don't know.
That's in my opinion that's not an
excuse. So, sorry. You were saying so is
this a four-year degree?
Yeah, for a year.
Do you mind saying is this in the US?
No, no, no.
You mind saying the country?
Um, yeah, it's Indonesia.
Okay.
I don't know anything about Indonesia.
Indonesian CS programs.
Um,
okay.
How would you do inheritance in Python?
How would you how would you inherit from
a class in Python?
uh return
return
what can you explain that a little
so let's say you have a class uh let's
say class and inside that class there's
this uh variables called a and a a
equals equals one and then if you uh
return.
If at the bottom you return the A, that
would means that the A is the inherited
uh inherited object.
Let's say I have like um
class A and class B and class A is a
parent of class B. So B inherits from A.
B is a child of A.
So how would I write that relationship
between class B and class A in Python to
reflect their inheritance hierarchy?
So first you uh
class A and then uh write the class B
within the class A indentation.
Uh what what does that look like? What
do you mean write it within the class A
indentation?
To be honest, uh like I'm not really
sure.
Okay.
Um, yeah. I don't know what you're doing
at all with machine learning. You should
stay far away from that. It's such a
mistake and I see it all the time. I
want to be this advanced machine
learning engineer. It's like
you don't even know how to figure out
what version of Python you're using.
What are you doing with machine
learning? Like, it's it's just I'm
trying not to be harsh, but I think this
is a wakeup call for you. Especially if
you start interviewing, dude. you will
get nowhere not knowing these things
cuz like with Python like I skip like
the basics like I just straight up to
like um training model and then
deploying it cuz that's cuz that's like
how do you really
how do how are you what what models are
you training
like I've used uh I've trained yolo and
uh and NLP uh specifically Uh,
LSDN.
I don't even understand how you're using
these libraries when you don't know what
a default argument is. That's my
confusion
cuz I use chat GPT,
right? So, you're not actually coding.
Yeah.
But then how how did you get through
school four years and graduate?
[Music]
be honest with me. Nobody knows your
name. Nobody knows who you are, where
you're from.
I'm still trying to think of it. Wait.
So like uh my program had not just like
coding but also like computer networking
and system operation system operating
system. And by the end of the programs,
like I don't really do any coding cuz it
was just like uh software architecture
where you don't really code.
But I did ask you about the stack in the
heap and you said you had no idea what
that was and that's operating systems
101. So like clearly some something is
not clicking or you're not learning or
you're ignoring like I I don't know what
to I don't I'm trying to figure that
out.
Probably forgot about it.
You don't forget about these things.
It's like saying I forgot how to ride a
bicycle. Right.
Let let me ask you um you mentioned
networking, right?
Right.
Do you know what TCP is?
Yeah. PCP that's the uh
protocol for file transfer that you wait
for the uh like example the client uh
send the packet to the server and then
uh before the client send the uh the
next packet you wait for the server to
send the receive signal. and make sure
the packet uh
I said TCP. TCP, not FTP.
TCP.
What does TCP stand for?
It's uh
Yeah, I forgot.
Uh transmission control protocol.
Yeah.
Yeah. Um dude, your school wasted four
years of your life.
I don't know. Are your peers at the same
level or are your peers more advanced,
less advanced?
So like um so like I have like a few
like peers that are extremely crackly. I
mean they're already like working while
I'm while studying. So like many of them
like have like two years of
internship/time
jobs while doing uh studying as as well.
But
uh some part like my class didn't
graduate like only like two two third of
my class graduated uh at 4 years.
So what happened to the other oneird
they passed away or what happened?
uh they haven't like they haven't
finished yet cuz like they got a lot of
stuff like that class they failed or uh
yeah mostly just classes that they
failed and they have to retake it so
they have to add a semester or two. What
are they failing cuz clearly they're not
learning anything. So how can you fail a
course that doesn't teach you anything?
So I'm I'm kind of curious how you
passed in four years and they're still
struggling. What does that mean? What
does that say about them?
and the the courses.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess so.
It's just Yeah. You just need to
understand that you're not where you
need to be and to get to where you are
where you want to be. It's going to take
you need to like relearn everything
honestly.
Yeah. I feel like
pluralite basics.
Go. Sorry, say that again.
I feel like I skip like all the like
important steps and just like go
straight to the like the advanced stuff
without knowing. thing is I can
guarantee you if I ask you about the
advanced stuff, you also won't know it.
There's nobody out there that knows the
advanced stuff but doesn't know how to
how to create a list in Python.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So when you're saying you're deploying
all these models, I just know you're
using Chad GPT.
True.
You know, so and like you don't actually
know the advanced stuff. You just do it,
but you're not doing it. It's it's chat
GPT doing it for you.
So all good, man. And I mean like listen
at least now you know that you really
need to start learning because there's
only up from where you are honestly.
Right.
Any questions?
Right. Right. Um
maybe that's a question but I I think I
have like uh like if I'm if I'm cook
like most people are cook as well like I
mean in my country cuz like most not
most like some of my peers are basically
they're just like I don't know I don't
want to bring them down but they Yeah.
So
okay but that's a coping mechanism.
That's not an excuse.
Right. Right. Right. Right. And I uh I I
did like some web def too like uh react
like the kind of web devs.
Okay. You use react.
Yeah.
Do you know what they use use state call
is in react?
Use state that's for uh for the cons. So
that would be
for the what
the state uh the cons. So use like cons
let's say. So it's the like variables
for the state like the const.
I don't know how you say it.
Const. No, you said it. Const is is
const is how you declare a variable and
you want to make sure that it its
reference doesn't change. But what does
that have to do with use state?
What do you mean use state is for const?
Uh it's the uh it's the
state like it's too uh like I don't know
how I don't know how to explain it but
okay bro you didn't you didn't do react
I I read the like
learn react react.dev dev like learn
react tutorial. But
clearly though it didn't stick because
you stated I don't know I don't even
know how to parse the statement you
stated for cons. I don't even know what
that means.
Kind of like reiterating but uh I should
like [ __ ] learn like from the start.
Yeah, you learn from like bare bones
and like for projects like most of my
projects like I couldn't really build
them without chat. So I guess that's
like the main problem with me. So, I got
to stop using
Don't Don't say it's a problem with you
because I don't want you to personalize
it. It's a problem with your learning.
Like, you need to lock in, you know,
like you're not you don't have a mental
deficiency. You sound like you're an
intelligent person. You can hold a
conversation. It's just like you
you don't know what you should.
Right. Right. Right.
Right. All right.
All right. Anything else?
Um, I guess that's it.
All right, bro. Good luck on the
journey.
Right. Thank you, bro.
Yeah. See you.
We have mad cracked people in the chat.
We have both ends of the scale. We have
cracked people and people on crack.
