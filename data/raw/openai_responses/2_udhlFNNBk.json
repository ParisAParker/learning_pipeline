By not having to worry about re-election, judges can make decisions based solely on the law and the Constitution, rather than public opinion. This independence is crucial for judges to act as 'bulwarks of a limited constitution against legislative encroachments.'\",\n        \"explanation\": \"Lifetime appointments prevent judges from being influenced by political pressures or the need to please voters, allowing them to focus on the faithful execution of their duties.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"How does Hamilton justify the power of judicial review in Federalist 78?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Hamilton justifies judicial review by arguing that any act of a delegated authority contrary to the Constitution is void. The judiciary's role is to interpret the Constitution and ensure that no laws passed by the legislature violate it, thereby acting as an intermediary between the people and the legislature.\",\n        \"explanation\": \"Hamilton sees judicial review as a necessary function of the judiciary to uphold the Constitution and prevent legislative overreach, not as a source of undue power.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What concerns did anti-federalists have about life tenure for judges, and how did Hamilton address these concerns?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Anti-federalists were concerned that life tenure would make judges unaccountable to the public.

Its power is limited to judgment and relies on the executive to enforce its rulings, making it the least dangerous branch.\",\n        \"explanation\": \"The judiciary's reliance on other branches for enforcement and its focus on interpreting laws limit its ability to threaten liberty.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"How does Hamilton's argument for judicial independence reflect broader Enlightenment ideas about government?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Hamilton's argument reflects Enlightenment ideas about checks and balances, separation of powers, and the role of reason and law in governance.
